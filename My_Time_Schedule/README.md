### This file is part of a tutorial:
Go on [my tutolibro.tech post]( https://tutolibro.tech/2018/05/02/tutorial-make-a-time-schedule-in-libreoffice-using-formulas-and-a-simple-macro/) for the step by step tutorial on making a simple time Schedule. This tutorial is in 10 easy parts to learn about some useful LibreOffice Functions and Formulas as well as other LibreOffice Features.

### Enable Macro:
When opening the file in LibreOffice, choose **Enable Macro** at the prompt to be able to use the file as a dynamic time schedule. If you just want to look at the formula and the (very) simple macro choose **Disable Macro** at the prompt, this will disable the recalc function to run every time you click somewhere in the table making it easier to navigate and edit the formulas and to look at the macro.

### Requirements:
You need to have LibreOffice installed on your machine. This file was created with LibreOffice 6.1 but it should works with older versions and later as well. It might even work with Excel, let me know if you feel adventurous!
