### This is part of a tutorial
Go on [my SuperBusyDaddy LibreOffice post-style link]( http://superbusydaddy.com/blog/2018/05/02/tutorial-make-a-time-schedule-in-libreoffice-using-formulas-and-a-simple-macro/) for the step by step tutorial on making a simple time Schedule.

### Enable Macro:
When opening the file in LibreOffice, choose *Enable Macro* at the prompt to be able to use the file as a dynamic time schedule. If you just want to look at the formula and the (very) simple macro) choose *Disable Macro* at teh prompt.
